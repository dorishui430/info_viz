Visualization 1

Introduction: This project aims to provide a visualisation for US airline/airport operation teams to analyze flight optimisation.

Dataset: Flight delay and cancellation dataset (2019-2023) from Kaggle

Objectives:
- Study how the pandemic breakout in 2020 impacted the US aviation industry by visualizing the variation in the number of flights
- Analyse the relationship between number of flights and average departure delay by the combined bar-line chart
- Provide insights for target users to review strategies related to manpower, airport hardware, and security processes to optimise efficiency

Skills:
- Python: Plotly
- Data Visualization: data abstraction, visual encoding, task abstraction
